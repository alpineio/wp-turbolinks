== Description ==

Turbolinks makes navigating your web application faster. Get the performance benefits of a single-page application
without the added complexity of a client-side JavaScript framework. Use HTML to render your views on the server side and
link to pages as usual. When you follow a link, Turbolinks automatically fetches the page, swaps in its <body>, and
merges its <head>, all without incurring the cost of a full page load.

The Turbolinks JavaScript referenced in the plugin can be found at https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks

== Installation ==

Turbolinks automatically initializes itself when loaded via a standalone <script> tag or a traditional concatenated
JavaScript bundle.
